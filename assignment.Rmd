For the final assignment of Coursera course, Practical Machine Learning, I have analyzed exercise movement data and predicted 20 test cases.

Human Activity Recognition Data is generously provided by the following website, http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

Some additional reading for the assignment:

1. What is the real difference between CV and repeatedCV? For our assignment, Cross Validation is more appropriate than repeated Cross Validation, I read the answers in the attached link. See below second section for this.

2. Actual code behind the parameters in Caret package

3. How to make RMD file for assignment submission

So let's get started! First we clean the data set.

```
pmlTrain<-read.csv("~/desktop/pml-training.csv", header=T, na.strings=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
pmlTest<-read.csv("~/desktop/pml-testing.csv", header=T, na.string=c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))

cleanedpmlTrain<-pmlTrain[, apply(pmlTrain, 2, function(x) !any(is.na(x)))] 
dim(cleanedpmlTrain)

cleanerpmlTrain<-cleanedpmlTrain[,-c(1:7)]
dim(cleanerpmlTrain)

cleanerpmltest<-pmlTest[,names(cleanerpmlTrain[,-53])]
dim(cleanerpmltest)
```

Now the fun part!

```
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)

View(cleanerpmltest)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=cleanerpmlTrain$classe, p=0.75,list=F)
training<-cleanerpmlTrain[inTrain,] 
test<-cleanerpmlTrain[-inTrain,] 

set.seed(4506)
cvControlTrain<-trainControl(method="cv",number=5, allowParallel=T, verbose=T)
rfTrain<-train(classe~.,data=training, method="rf", trControl=cvControlTrain, verbose=F)

result<-predict(rfTrain, newdata=test)
confusionMatrix(result, test$classe)

finaltest <-predict(rfTrain, newdata=cleanerpmltest)
finaltest

```

Accuracy was 99.31% and I got 20/20 when I used on the 20 test cases.


Well, this was a very exciting assignment. Can't wait to use what I learned in this course to a tougher data set.
